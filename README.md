# Object-Detection-Mask-Rcnn-image-
Object Detection from a image using Mask-R-CNN

Object detection is a well-known computer technology  connected with computer vision and image processing that focuses on detecting objects or its instances of a certain class (such as humans, flowers, animals) in digital images and videos.  There are various applications of object detection that have been well researched including face detection, character recognition, and vehicle calculator. Object detection can be used for various purposes including retrieval and surveillance. In this we are going to detect the object in the particular given image using mask-r-cnn algorithm

System Requirements:-
Python 3.8

HD/ 4k Image (The quality of the output will be based upon the quality of the onput image.) 

RAM 4gb (minimum)


Required Libraries:-
OpenCv

Mask R-CNN

Pixellib

Coco

Gtts

Os

Using this Object Detection method we can detect the object present in the image (example â€“ humans, animals, fruits, vehicles etc.) given by the user. After detecting it will differentiate the identified object in different colors. It will also display the name of the object on the top of the object in the text format. For example if it identify a dog means it will display dog in top of that object. And then it will has the audio output if the detected object.
Note: audio output is created by GTTS(google text to speech
